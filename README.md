# Haskell Tic Tac Toe

- Here's anothe functional implementation of TicTacToe I've bashed out for
  fun. This time in Haskell - my absolute favourite programming language.
  
## How to run

- If you have cabal:
```bash
cabal run
```

- If not :
```bash
ghc --make Main.hs && ./Main
```

## How to play
1. each player inputs a number from 1-9 for the position they want to occupy.
2. Have fun.
